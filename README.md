# 431W-Final-project

Our project was a success overall, thanks to a clear division of labor and effective collaboration within the team. While adhering to our team contract, we made adjustments to the division of responsibilities based on individual strengths to enhance efficiency.
James Hu took the lead in coding and constructing the core framework of the project, leveraging his programming expertise. jingxuan Qiu, focused on designing the ER diagram and writing the project report. This division of labor allowed each team member to focus on their strengths and contribute meaningfully to the project.
Despite having defined roles, we maintained open communication throughout the process, which allowed us to address challenges promptly and ensure smooth progress. Overall, we are satisfied with the outcomes of our collaboration.
However, there are areas for improvement. Time management was a recurring challenge for us. We often procrastinated, leaving tasks until close to their deadlines. This habit prevented us from refining our work to the level we desired. Recognizing this as a learning opportunity, we aim to improve our scheduling and task management in future projects to ensure we meet deadlines while delivering polished results.
